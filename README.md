# ObjectTracker3.1
Single or multiple tracking can be done in the code. For this you just need to change the SINGLE_FILE_ANALYSIS parameter in the script.When the tracking algorithm is started, a gui will open on the side. You can select the Stop button to stop, the Finish button to finish, the Back and Next buttons to switch between frames, and the New Roi button to select a new ROI. To switch to a frame you want, you must first press the Wanted button and enter the number in the box (When you press the first Wanted button, the 1st frame will go away, don't worry, what happened until then has been recorded.)
